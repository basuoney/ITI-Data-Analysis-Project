Associate (PL-300) certification. I am a proud graduate of the ITI Power BI Developer Track and the Data-X Diploma, where I gained deep hands-on experience in analyzing, modeling, and visualizing data across multiple business domains.  Throughout my journey, I have worked on numerous projects using Power BI, developing dynamic dashboards, data models, and DAX-based insights that drive smarter decisions. I also bring strong expertise in Excel (Power Pivot, Power Query, DAX, Cube Functions, Data Modeling) and have solid experience in Tableau for advanced visual storytelling.  My technical foundation also extends to SQL-BI tools (SSIS, SSAS, SSRS) — enabling me to manage data workflows end-to-end and deliver complete business intelligence solutions.  In addition, I’ve successfully completed several freelance projects on Upwork, collaborating with international clients and helping them uncover valuable insights through clean, structured, and interactive data solutions.  Driven by curiosity and continuous learning, I’m passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful insights that add measurable value and fuel innovation.
